Phones are branded for NTT DOCOMO JAPAN so it will have a few Japanese apps, however the menus are in English and the phone is unlocked for use on some GSM networks. We have successfully tested this model with SIM cards from T-Mobile, Bell Canada and Telus. If you plan to use this phone with another network, please verify the sample IMEI (353652091517095) with your carrier PRIOR to purchase to confirm compatibility.
